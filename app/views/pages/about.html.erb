                        My name is Julia Lokerson, and I am a Computer Science student at Clemson University, working toward both my
                        Bachelor's and Master's degrees through an accelerated program. I have a strong academic foundation in
                        algorithms, data structures, and full-stack development, and I've applied these skills through coursework
                        and practical projects. My work includes developing cipher decoding tools in Python, creating a mock
                        e-commerce website using HTML and Ruby, and programming games such as Tic Tac Toe, Checkers, and 2D
                        platformers using Java and Pygame. I'm also a member of Upsilon Pi Epsilon, the international computer
                        science honor society, and the Clemson chapter of the ACM. My technical experience spans languages like
                        Python, JavaScript, C++, and C#, with additional skills in Unity, Maya, and digital illustration through my
                        Digital Production Arts minor. I'm passionate about using programming to solve real-world problems and to
                        build engaging, interactive experiences.

                        At Clemson University, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a minor in Digital
                        Production Arts, and I am on track to complete an accelerated Master of Science in Computer Science by the
                        end of 2026. My coursework has provided a solid foundation in core areas such as data structures,
                        algorithms, and web development, while also allowing me to explore specialized topics through hands-on
                        projects. I've developed Python programs for word cipher analysis, built a functional e-commerce website
                        using HTML and Ruby, and created games using Java and Pygameâ€”all of which have strengthened my
                        problem-solving and software design skills. I've been recognized on the Dean's List multiple times and am a
                        member of both the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and Upsilon Pi Epsilon, the international honor
                        society for computing. My time at Clemson has given me not only the technical skills but also the practical
                        experience needed to succeed in complex and collaborative development environments.

                        I have experience with a range of programming languages and development tools, including Python, JavaScript,
                        C, C++, C#, Ruby, HTML, and Java. I'm also familiar with version control using Git, database management with
                        MySQL, and working in Linux environments such as Ubuntu. This diverse skill set has allowed me to build
                        everything from web applications to game projects and command-line tools, giving me a solid foundation for
                        both front-end and back-end development.
