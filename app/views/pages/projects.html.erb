                            As part of a web development course, I created a fully functional mock e-commerce website using HTML and
                            Ruby. The site featured a clean layout with product listings, detailed item descriptions, and image
                            support. I implemented a shopping cart system that allowed users to add and remove items dynamically, view
                            their total purchase cost, and proceed to a basic checkout interface. Through this project, I gained
                            hands-on experience with front-end and back-end integration, and I learned how to manage user interactions
                            and state across different components of a web application. This project solidified my understanding of
                            web design fundamentals and taught me the importance of user-friendly interfaces and modular, maintainable
                            code.

                            As part of a collaborative group project, I worked on a crime scene simulator built in Unity for the Meta
                            Quest VR platform. The goal was to create an immersive investigation experience where users could explore
                            a virtual crime scene, collect evidence, and solve a mystery using a combination of logic and
                            environmental clues. My primary responsibilities included scripting the object interaction system using
                            C#, managing how players pick up, examine, and store evidence. I also developed a point tracking system
                            that awarded or deducted points based on correct or incorrect interactions with objects. To support
                            narrative progression, I built a dynamic UI tablet system that players could access within the VR
                            environment. This included a Table of Contents, multiple-choice questions, witness testimony pages, and an
                            “End Investigation” section that calculated and displayed the final score. Working in Unity for VR taught
                            me how to design user interactions in three-dimensional space, optimize assets for performance on Meta
                            Quest hardware, and coordinate with a team across different development roles. This project gave me
                            valuable experience in immersive design, player feedback systems, and VR development workflows.

                            In Your Dreams is a custom-built 2D platformer developed in Pygame, set in a surreal dreamscape filled
                            with nighttime skies, clouds, and shifting dreamlike visuals. All assets were custom-designed to reflect a
                            soft, ethereal aesthetic that matched the game&#39;s dream-based narrative. The core gameplay centers
                            around a unique mechanic that allows players to spawn their own cloud-like platforms in real time, using
                            them strategically to dodge enemies, navigate hazards, and reach hidden areas. Players must collect keys
                            to unlock progression gates and ultimately face a final boss that challenges their mastery of the
                            platforming and spawning mechanics. I programmed the core physics system, custom collision detection,
                            platform spawning behavior, and enemy logic using object-oriented design principles. This project taught
                            me how to balance technical systems with creative mechanics, optimize sprite performance, and create
                            engaging level designs that encourage exploration and experimentation.
